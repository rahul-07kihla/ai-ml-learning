# ai-ml-learning

Three type of AI
1. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) - self driven car
2. Generative AI - chatgpt, Dall-E
3. AGI (Artificial General Intelligenece) - all human can do

Machine learning
LLM (Large Language Model)
superwise learning

What is data?
collection of information which is classifiable

Machine learning vs data science
Machine learning - for example advetisement company analys the ad is how many time ad clicked
data science - for example how many time spend on that page

what is deep learning
input -> Neural Network -> output

AI transformation
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
4. Develop an AI strategy
5. Develop internal and external communications

Machine Learning can and can not
can not do
1. predicting the stock market
2. human gesture identification on the road ex. bike turn left signal

what we need for this
1. Data
2. Need high accuracy

can do
1. self driving car

data science project
1. Collect data
2. Analyze data
3. Suggest hypotheses/actions

Libraries for the AI/ML
1. easyocr - image to text extraction (https://www.jaided.ai/easyocr/install/)
2. google-cloud-vision - with remote image also local (https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr#vision_text_detection_gcs-python)
